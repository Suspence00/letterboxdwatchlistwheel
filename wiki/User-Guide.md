# User Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of using the Letterboxd Watchlist Wheel to pick your next movie.

## 1. Importing Your Watchlist

The first step is to get your movies into the wheel. You have two main options:

### Option A: Direct Import (Recommended)
1.  Go to the **"1. Bring in your Letterboxd picks"** section.
2.  Copy the URL of a Letterboxd list or your profile URL (e.g., `https://letterboxd.com/yourusername/watchlist/`).
3.  Paste it into the **Letterboxd URL or profile name** field.
4.  Click **Import to the wheel**.

### Option B: CSV Upload
1.  Export your data from Letterboxd (Settings > Import & Export > Export Your Data).
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  In the wheel app, click **Choose CSV file** under "Prefer to upload a CSV?".
4.  Select your `watchlist.csv` file.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use the "Download helper" link in the app to generate a clean CSV from a list if you prefer manual file handling.

## 2. Curating Your Wheel

Once your movies are loaded, they will appear in the **"2. Curate your wheel"** section.

*   **Select/Deselect:** Use the checkboxes next to each movie to include or exclude them from the spin.
*   **Bulk Actions:** Use **Select all** or **Clear all** buttons to quickly manage large lists.
*   **Search:** Use the search bar in "Advanced options" to find specific titles.
*   **Custom Entries:** Want to add a movie not on your list? Use the "Add a custom entry" form to type in a title and add it to the mix.

### Advanced Options
Check the **Advanced options** box to reveal more controls:
*   **Weights:** Increase the "weight" of a movie to make it more likely to win (or harder to eliminate in Knockout mode).
*   **Colors:** Customize the color of each movie's slice on the wheel.

## 3. Spinning the Wheel

Scroll down to **"3. Spin the wheel"**.

*   **Standard Spin:** Click **Spin the wheel** to start. The wheel will spin and land on a winner!
*   **Knockout Mode:** If you have multiple movies selected and haven't enabled "One Spin to Rule them all", the button will say **Start Movie Knockout mode**. This runs a "battle royale" where spins eliminate movies until only one remains.
*   **One Spin Mode:** Enable "One Spin to Rule them all" in Advanced Options for a classic single-winner spin.

## History
Click the **History** button to see a log of your past winners. This is saved in your browser so you can come back to it later.
